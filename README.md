# CountFiles

 Steps through a directory and outputs a count of each filetype inside.

* Asks for a directory via drag-and-drop.
* Walks through the directory and subdirectories and generates a dictionary of extensions and their counts.
* Displays the totals for each extension to the console.
* Outputs a file ("file_counts.txt") to the repo's directory with the extensions and counts.

```bash
$ python3 countfiles
```
